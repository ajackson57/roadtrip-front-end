## Introduction RoadtripFrontEnd
This project provides the frontend for a basic roadtrip (could be walking tour) mapping application, facilitated by the google mapping api. The backend web service repository can be found in the link listed below.

## Instructions
- [Get Started](https://ajackson57.github.io/roadtrip-frontend/)
- As a user you must register for an account. Once an account is created you
  login and you can display, create, edit, and delete trips/maps.
- [Backend Server hosted on Heroku](https://calm-brook-66488.herokuapp.com/)

## Technologies used.
- **Styling** - The Boostrap NAV bar and basic styling were used.
- **HTML** - A table is used to display the list of contacts.
- **JavaScript** - Events from the table, butons, and the navigation bar drive
  the application
- **Handlebars** - The contact table and entry form were done with html in
  handlebar tamplates.
- **Ruby on Rails** - The backend server was developed with Ruby's Rails
  framework. Ajax used on the frontend to make requests of the Rails server.

## The Devlopment Story
[Initial Schedule](https://github.com/ajackson57/aj-networking-contacts-frontend/blob/master/Schedule.pdf)
 - **The Development Process**
 - The development process started with some rough wireframes, some user
   stories, and a quick planning outline. I divided development into feature
   groups and created a branch in Git for each group. The branches for this
   repository (frontend) were as follows:
      -

 - **Problem-Solving Strategy**
 - I used the debugging facilities in the DevTools. I analyized error messages, setup breakpoints, and stepped through the code examining values of objects as I stepped through.
