## Introduction RoadtripFrontEnd
This project provides the frontend for a basic roadtrip (could be walking tour) mapping application, facilitated by the google mapping api. The backend web service repository can be found in the link listed below.
- [Backend Repository](https://github.com/ajackson57/roadtrip-backend)

## Instructions
- [Get Started](https://ajackson57.github.io/roadtrip-frontend/)
- As a user you must register for an account. Once an account is created you
  login and you can display, create, edit, and delete trips/maps.
- [Backend Server hosted on Heroku](https://calm-brook-66488.herokuapp.com/)

## Technologies used.
- **Styling** - The Boostrap NAV bar and basic styling were used.
- **Angular2** - Angular2 provides the fortend workflow.
- **AngularFlashMessage** - Error handling and some friendly user feedback is
  provides by AngularFlashMessages
- [Angular Google Maps](https://angular-maps.com/)
  Provides the mapping capability.
- **Ruby on Rails** - The backend server was developed with Ruby's Rails
  framework. Ajax used on the frontend to make requests of the Rails server.
- [ERD for backend DB](https://github.com/ajackson57/roadtrip-backend/blob/master/GA-WDI-Capstone.pdf)
  The ERD has been updated to include location, longitude and latitude for each marker.

## The Devlopment Story
[Initial Schedule](https://github.com/ajackson57/roadtrip-frontend/blob/master/Capstone%20Roadtrip%20Tasks.pdf)
 - **The Development Process**
 - The development process started with some rough wireframes, some user
   stories, and a quick planning outline. I divided development into feature
   groups and created a branch in Git for each group.

 - **Problem-Solving Strategy**
 - I used the debugging facilities in the DevTools. I analyized error messages, setup breakpoints, and stepped through the code examining values of objects as I stepped through.

## Current Issues to be resolved in the future
- **Future Enhancements**
- Add Geocoding for addresses to obtain longitude and latitude
- Add a direction list capability
- Add a route plotting capability
